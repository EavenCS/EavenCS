# Hi 👋, I'm Eaven
# 👩🏼‍💻Languages and Tools

In the year 2020, at the tender age of seventeen, I accomplished the feat of successfully obtaining my secondary school leaving certificate II. Following this achievement, I embarked on a new journey as an application developer in the specialized field of Microsoft Dynamics, beginning on the 1st of August, 2020. As I delve deeper into my training and eventual career, my primary focus will be on programming for the ERP solution, Microsoft Dynamics 365. Additionally, I am an avid learner, and in my free time, I am teaching myself the intricacies of the cross-platform framework, Flutter, as a hobby. Not much will be uploaded to my Github profile for now because I'm not allowed to publish the source code I write at work.
