# Hi there!👋

## About Me🤵🏼
I successfully completed my secondary school leaving certificate II in 2020 at the age of seventeen, started my training as an application developer in the specialist area of Microsoft Dynamics in the same year on 01.08.2020.

My focus in the training and future work will initially be the programming of the ERP solution Microsoft Dynamics 365.

As a hobby, I am teaching myself the cross-platform framework Flutter.
